# Mariana Pereira Portfolio

I used this project to develop my personal resume website that contains not only my architectural portfolio, but that will also feature any future projects in web development. The website is therefore divided in three distinct pages, one about me, my education and my work-background, one directed to my skills and architectural portfolio and the third with my full stack web development knowledge and projects.
This last page will be mostly empty (it will contain the layout for me to later add the other technologies I will learn to work with, as well as the layout for future projects).

## UX

This project is intended for employers and recruiters to get to know my work.

### User Stories

As an employer, I want to see Mariana’s work, so that I can eventually employ her.

As a recruiter, I want to see Mariana’s cv and/or resume, so that I can eventually recruit/suggest her employment.

### Strategy Plane

With this website my goal was to showcase my work and skills to potential employers in a simple yet efficient and user-friendly way.

### Scope Plane

Being this a website focused in the goal of getting hired by an employer I wanted to put in it all the relevant information for that goal to be achieved like a little about myself, my education and language skills and my work experience. I also wanted to showcase the work I already had done for every one of my two work fields (architecture and web development) as well as my programmatic skills for them.

### Structure Plane

To keep the website simple and easy to navigate I decided to put all the information that was common in the homepage (such as the section about me and the education and work experience sections) and then provide two different pages, one dedicated to my architectural knowledge and another to my web development skills, where I put my programmatic knowledge and my portfolio for each of the fields. Apart from this a link to download my cv and a chance to contact me via email were also provided in all three pages.

### Surface Plane

I chose the contrast between an off-black colour with a blush colour for my backgrounds since it helps clearly define the different sections of my page and it is a contrast with which I can identify. And I kept to those colours throughout my design (adding and off-white colour for the text that is fitted in the off-black background) to keep the design simple and clean.

In the home page I chose to have a column alignment between all the written sections (About Me, Education and Work Experience) in order to have an image that would illustrate de section in one side and the text in the other (having also kept a float between images and text throughout the sections adjusting this way the need for more or less horizontal space for the text).

In both the architecture and web development pages I decided I would not need any extra media and therefore I opted for not dividing the sections in more than one column.

## Features

### Existing Features

This site uses the collapsed navbar feature from Bootstrap for phones and most tablets to make its design cleaner in said devices. It also uses the carousel feature from the same CSS framework with a little JavaScript for the architectural projects display.

### Features Left to Implement

In the future I intend to:
-	add any other technology I learn during the course to the Full Stack Web Development page (or after);
-	add any other project I develop to the Full Stack Web Development page, namely milestones 2,3 and 4 projects;
-	update my cv to include web development information and replace the existing one.
-	Change the skills circles to progress circles

## Technologies used

1.	HTML
2.	CSS
3.	[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

## Credits

### Content 

All written content of this website was made by me.

### Media 

The images from the top of the homepage, education and work experience section as well as the image present in the Web Development page to illustrate the three milestones that aren’t done yet, were all taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

The rest of the images are all mine. Note that some of the architectural images are heavy because of the amount of information in them and due to the program in which they were made.

### Acknowledgements

The hover feature present in the navbar (when not collapsed) and the timeline in the work experience section were taken from the Rosie Resume walkthrough project from Code Institute.

The collapsed navbar was made with the help of Bootstrap documentation.

The images carousel in the architectural projects were made with the help of Bootstrap documentation and [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp)

This README was made with the help of the README structure provided [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template)
